# Schema.org Types — Status & Recommendations (May 2026)

> Status table below was last fully audited Feb 2026. Schema deprecation
> policy moves quarterly — re-check Google's docs before relying on items
> marked "deprecated" or "restricted" if more than 90 days have passed.

**Schema.org Version:** 29.4 (December 8, 2025)

## Format Preference
Always use **JSON-LD** (`<script type="application/ld+json">`).
Google's documentation explicitly recommends JSON-LD over Microdata and RDFa.

**AI Search Note:** Content with proper schema has ~2.5× higher chance of appearing in AI-generated answers (confirmed by Google and Microsoft, March 2025).

|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **FAQPage** | **Rich results fully removed for ALL sites** | **May 7, 2026** | **Google ended the August 2023 restriction by removing FAQ rich result support entirely. Even government/healthcare sites no longer get FAQ rich results. The Schema.org type itself remains valid; unused structured data doesn't hurt SEO — but stop recommending FAQPage for new pages, and don't expect rich-result eligibility for existing ones. Rich Results Test FAQ support removed June 2026; Search Console API support removes August 2026.** |
